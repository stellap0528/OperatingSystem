1. In the kernel, programs were created to print a file to the console (readFile). We also created a method "executeProgram" for running programs on the disk. Lastly, we created a shell to take in commands and pass them to the kernel.

2. To verify readFile, type "type messag" into the shell - it should print "If this message prints out...". To verify execule program, type "execute tstpr2" into the shell and the "If you see this..." message will print out.
